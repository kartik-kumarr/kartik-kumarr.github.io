Iâ€™m a Coutelle PhD candidate at Deakin University, Australia, and Coventry University, England. I am conducting research in computer vision and reinforcement learning. With the soul of an engineer, I am passionate about the practical applications of my work and bringing innovative solutions into the real world. I am deeply interested in the theoretical and applied artificial intelligence, especially deep neural networks and their diverse applications. Currently, my research focuses on leveraging these technologies to push the boundaries of what's possible.
