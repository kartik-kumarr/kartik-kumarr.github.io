Iâ€™m a Cotutelle(Dual) PhD candidate at Deakin University, Australia, and Coventry University, England. I am conducting research in computer vision and reinforcement learning. With the soul of an engineer, I am passionate about the practical applications of my work and bringing innovative solutions into the real world. I am deeply interested in the theoretical and applied artificial intelligence. Currently, my research focuses on leveraging these technologies to push the boundaries of what's possible.
